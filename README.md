# react-native-boilerplate

Project starting and set up is always crucial and time consuming task because we may need to take care of many thing and need to add our regular utilities we are using with all projects. Its will be better to create single project with all these requirements and keep it updated to time to time with new updates. Starterkit or boiler plate of any framework will save lots of time and we are able to start directly with requirements without worriying about initial setup for project.

Here i have create simple boiler plate for my React Native project. I have set up redux-saga for it and other required components.

In this boiler plate i have added flow like login and tabbar as i know there are most of project comes with login and tabbar functionalies.

In addition to that added redux with api service set up and realm too. 

Hope this will be useful to other person too.
